# Object Detection Using Artifical Intelligence 

## Description
 Thereâ€™s no shortage of fascinating problems in computer vision, with object detection being one of the most interesting computer vision technique in which a software system can detect, locate, and trace the object from a given image or video.object detection is to determine where objects are located in a given image (object localization) and which category each object belongs to (object classification).Object localization refers to identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing the box around their extent. 
 
 Object classification involves identifying the class of one object in an image. Object Detection(Our project) combines these two tasks and identifies and classifies one or more objects in an image.
 
 object detection is able to provide valuable information for good understanding of images and videos, and is related to many applications, including image classification, human behavior analysis, face recognition, autonomous driving, video surveillance, and healthcare.
 
 Our motive is to train system with different datasets to detect objects.And create a system which detects object in an image by bounding around them and classifies to which class it belongs to.
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sundar1872/Object-Detection.git
```
```bash
cd Object-Detection/Object-Detection
```
Create a Virtual Env with Python version 3.9.6
Install the dependencies with 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then Run the Object-Detection.ipynb file
