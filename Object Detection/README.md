# Summary

This is a complete guide for the Code Implementation of our Project Report.

This report is to how to train a model to detect various .

The ipynb to train and test the model is :

[OBJECT DETECTION](https://github.com/Sundar1872/Object-Detection/blob/main/Object%20Detection/Object-Detection.ipynb)


## Dependencies

Associated with this project, there is a file, "requirements.txt" which lists all libraries that need to be installed before to run the application.After creating Virtual env with **Python version 3.9.6**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dataset is provided in the cell-1 (run the cell and the file provided in the link provided in the cell 1 uploads the weights file directly)

(or)

You can download the weights files [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) and upload it in a directory namely "data"




## Motivation

Our main motivation to select this topic is in present era with  the  rapidly  growing  importance  in  military  and  security  applications  visual  surveillance has  become  a  necessary  area  of  research for improvement . It   is very hard for human operators to monitor for long durations to identify the important events in real-time .But using this system we can detect the objects in the images of the video continuously in the military area to detect any suspicious activity
